# üìò Full Task Description:

# You're given a list of intervals, where each interval is a pair of numbers:
#  the start and end of a time range (or segment).
# If any intervals overlap, your goal is to merge them into one continuous interval.
# Input:  [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
# Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
# ‚ùì Why:
# [1, 3] and [2, 6] overlap, so we merge them into [1, 6].
# [8, 10] and [15, 18] don‚Äôt overlap with others ‚Äî they stay as they are.
